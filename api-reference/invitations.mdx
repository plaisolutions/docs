## Use Cases

### Invitation Flow

The invitation system follows this typical flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    An organization admin creates an invitation using the [`POST /organizations/{organization_id}/invitations`](organizations#add-invitation) endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share Invitation Link">
    The invitation link is shared with the recipient via email or other communication channels
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Invitation">
    The recipient uses this `GET /invitations/{id}` endpoint to view invitation details before accepting
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept/Decline">
    The recipient uses the [`POST /me/invitations/{invitation_id}/reply`](me#reply-to-invitation) endpoint to accept or decline
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Security Considerations

<Warning>
  This endpoint is public and does not require authentication. However, invitation IDs should be treated as sensitive and not shared publicly as they provide access to organization information.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Invitations have expiration periods and can be revoked by organization administrators at any time.
</Note>

### Error Responses
