## Step 1: Create the Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Project">
    1. Log in to [PLai Framework Dashboard](https://framework.plaisolutions.com)
    2. Select your organization and project
    3. Navigate to the **Agents** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Agent Creation">

    **Name**: `Customer Support Agent`
    **Description**: `Helpful customer support agent that can answer questions and provide assistance`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set System Instructions">
    Copy and paste this system prompt:
    
    ```text
    You are a helpful and professional customer support agent. Your role is to:
    
    1. Provide accurate and helpful information to customers

    - Always end conversations on a positive note
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure the Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select LLM Provider">
    Choose **OpenAI** as your provider (recommended for customer support)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Model">
    Select **GPT-4 Turbo** for the best performance, or **GPT-3.5 Turbo** for cost efficiency
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Parameters (Optional)">
    - **Temperature**: 0.3 (more focused responses)
    - **Max Tokens**: 1000 (sufficient for most support responses)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click **Save** to store your model configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Add Tools

Now let's enhance your agent with the Perplexity AI tool for real-time information lookup.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Tools">
    Go to the **Tools** section in your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Perplexity AI Tool">
    1. Click **Create Tool**
    2. Select **Perplexity AI**
    3. Configure the tool:
    
    **Name**: `Web Search Tool`
    **Model**: `sonar-pro`
    **System Message**: `Search for current information to help answer customer questions. Focus on official sources and recent information.`
    **Search Domain Filter**: Leave empty for general search
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Tool">
    Click **Test** and try a sample query like "latest iPhone features"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tool to Agent">
    1. Return to your agent's settings
    2. Go to the **Tools** tab
    3. Click **Add Tool** and select your "Web Search Tool"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Configure Agent Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Agent Avatar (Optional)">
    Upload a professional avatar image or use the default
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Features">
    Turn on these recommended features:
    - **File Upload**: Allow customers to share screenshots or documents
    - **Voice Input**: Enable voice conversations (if supported)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Guardrails">
    Set up basic safety measures:
    - Enable **Content Filtering**
    - Set **Rate Limiting** to 10 messages per minute
    - Enable **Inappropriate Content Detection**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Agent">
    Toggle the agent status to **Active**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Now let's test your agent with realistic customer support scenarios.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Test Chat">
    Click the **Chat** button on your agent to open the chat interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Basic Interaction">
    Try this conversation starter:
    
    **You**: `Hi, I need help with my account`
    
    Your agent should respond professionally and ask for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Tool Integration">
    Ask a question that requires current information:
    
    **You**: `What are the latest features in the iPhone 15?`
    
    Your agent should use the Perplexity tool to search for current information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Escalation">
    Present a complex scenario:
    
    **You**: `I've been charged twice for the same order and need an immediate refund`
    
    Your agent should recognize this needs human intervention.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Refine and Optimize

Based on your testing, let's optimize the agent's performance.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Improve System Instructions">
    If responses aren't quite right, refine your system prompt:
    
    ```text
    You are a helpful customer support agent for [Company Name]. 
    
    Key responsibilities:
    - Answer product questions using current information
    - Help with account and billing issues
    - Provide troubleshooting guidance
    - Escalate complex issues to human agents
    
    Response guidelines:
    - Keep responses under 150 words when possible
    - Use bullet points for step-by-step instructions
    - Always include next steps or follow-up actions
    - For billing issues, always escalate to human agents
    - For technical issues, try to resolve first, then escalate if needed
    
    Tone: Professional, helpful, and empathetic
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Adjust Tool Configuration">
    Fine-tune your Perplexity tool:
    
    ```text
    Search for the most current and accurate information to help answer customer questions. 
    Prioritize:
    1. Official company documentation
    2. Recent product announcements
    3. Authoritative news sources
    4. User guides and help articles
    
    Provide concise, actionable information.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Add More Tools (Optional)">
    Consider adding these tools as you grow:
    - **API Request Tool**: Connect to your CRM or help desk
    - **External Data Source**: Access customer database
    - **Browser Tool**: Scrape your own documentation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Configuration Tips

### Performance Optimization

<Tip>
**Response Speed**: Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for faster responses if speed is more important than complexity handling.
</Tip>

{
  "model_config": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "max_tokens": 500,
    "top_p": 0.9
  }
}
```
