## Best Practices

### Search Query Optimization

<Tip>
**Specific Queries**: More specific search requests yield better results. Instead of "market trends," try "SaaS market trends Q4 2024."
</Tip>

- **Use Keywords**: Include specific terms and phrases
- **Ask Questions**: Natural language questions work well
- **Specify Timeframes**: Include dates when relevance matters
- **Define Scope**: Clarify geographic or industry scope
- **Request Analysis**: Ask for comparisons or analysis explicitly

### System Message Best Practices

```yaml
Effective System Messages:
  ✅ "Search for recent developments in AI regulation, focusing on EU and US policies from 2024. Provide analysis of key differences and implications."
  ✅ "Find the latest earnings reports and analyst opinions for tech companies in the S&P 500. Summarize key trends and outlook."
  
Less Effective:
  ❌ "Search the web"
  ❌ "Find information"
```

### Domain Filtering Strategy

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Filter for authoritative sources
- **Avoid Echo Chambers**: Include diverse perspectives
- **Time Sensitivity**: Use recent sources for current events
- **Source Type**: Match source type to information need
- **Exclude Noise**: Remove forums and user-generated content when needed

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies

```json
{
  "cache_policy": {
    "enable": true,
    "ttl": 1800,
    "key_template": "perplexity_{{query_hash}}_{{domain_filter}}"
  }
}
```

### Cost Management

- **Model Selection**: Use appropriate model for task complexity
- **Query Optimization**: Craft efficient search queries
- **Result Caching**: Cache frequently requested information
- **Domain Filtering**: Reduce search scope when possible
